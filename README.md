# Pencil
## a dark theme for [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/)

This theme is based off of the [Graphite](https://github.com/gregnewman/limechat-graphite) theme, with the following changes:

* the console is now styled
* highlights stand out more
* probably other things that I've forgotten

It's not perfect, but it's getting there :)

### Installation

Easy peasy:

1. download Pencil as a [zip](https://github.com/tobias/limechat-pencil/zipball/master)
2. unzip it
3. run the included `install.sh`

The install script copies the css and yaml in to `~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes/`,
creating the dir as necessary.

If you'd rather clone the git repo and link the files, follow the lemon squeezy directions:

1. `git clone git://github.com/tobias/limechat-pencil.git`
2. run the included `install_as_links.sh`

The install script links the css and yaml in to `~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes/`,
creating the dir as necessary.

### License

Do what you want with it. If you make changes to it, let me know - I'd like to see them.
